\begin{abstract}
This essay serves as an in-depth introduction to the art of bit-manipulating operations.
The introduction covers bitwords (bitvectors) as well as logical operators and their representation as bitwise operands in a (high-level) programming language.

The focus lies on establishing a visual approach to familiar operations like incrementing a value.
After covering manipulation of rightmost bits,
those operators will be combined to form more powerful formulas.
They will then be wrapped up as the ``right to left computability class'',
which contains all bitword manipulations that can be expressed with a few elementary operations.

Finally, a method that reverses bitwords will be discussed.
It has been selected to augment the possbilities of ``right to left''-operations.
