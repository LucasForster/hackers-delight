\section{Hacker's Delight}\label{sec:book}
Inspired by and named after Henry Warren's book ``\emph{Hacker's Delight}''\cite{Warren:2012:HD:2462741},
this paper complements it with methods and explanations that have been left out by the author (intentionally):

``The presentation is informal. Proofs are given only when the algorithm is not obvious, and sometimes not even then.''

\end{quote}

Instead of simply explaining given formulas,
this essay assembles them from a few elementary operations in a stepwise manner.
Besides a fundamental understanding of the covered topics,
the aim is to provide the reader with methods that can be adapted and thereby used to create new formulas.
