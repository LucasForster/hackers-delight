``The fact that the carry chain allows a single bit
to affect all the bits to its left
makes addition a peculiarly powerful data manipulation operation''

\subsection*{Motivation}
As mentioned in \autoref{sec:book},
the goal is to complement ``Hacker's Delight''.
More concretely, the book starts out in chapter 2 with a list of formulas.
While it is possible to understand why they work as they do,
it is a completely different task to create these by yourself
-- this needs a systematic approach.
