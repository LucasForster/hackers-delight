\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
The first formulas introduced by Hacker's Delight \cite{Warren:2012:HD:2462741}
are the basis of any more complex operations in the book.
This paper not only explained why they work the way they are used,
but furthermore provided a systematic approach to create them from scratch.
Readers of the book therefore do not need to remember them
(or take them for granted).

In addition, the formulas have been identified to be part of
the right to left computability class,
which then has been proved to be a closed set
under the mentioned operations.
