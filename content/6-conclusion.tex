\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
The formulas introduced in the beginning of Hacker's Delight
\cite{Warren:2012:HD:2462741}
form a basis for more complex operations in the book
and have many applications in low level programming.
This paper not only explained why they work the way they do,
but moreover provided an approach to create them from scratch.

Readers who are involved with low level coding
should be encouraged to systematically combine the presented operations
in order to form a compact implementation of their desired function
(instead of searching for it through precompiled lists).
From a theoretical standpoint,
the presented formulas have been identified to be part of
the right to left computability class,
where all included functions can be expressed
with a small set of operations.
